The answer is it really depends. In fact, new programming languages are created to fulfill specific needs.\n","\n","For example, **Java** was invented to address **portability**. The most popular language prior to Java was **C/C++**, which is a **compiled language**. That means, C/C++ programs will only run on the platform for which it was complied. A platform, being for example, Mac vs PC vs Linux vs toaster oven. Yes, no joke, toaster oven! In fact, Java was designed so your program can run on a toaster oven without any extra work. Java is portable to any platform. Back in 1991, the inventor, **James Gosling**, envisioned a world in which everything was computerized and connected. And he was exactly right, a visionary. Java solves the problem of portability by introducing a middle-layer, the **Java virtual vachine**, or Java-VM. Code is compiled to run on the virtual machine, and every platform has it's own Java virtual machine, thus your code can run on every platform. So, Java is also a compiled language.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://studysection.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Python.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n","\n","Some say **Python is currently the most popular programming langauge** overall. What is **Python**? Unlike a compiled language, Python is an **interpreted language**. That means, on a given platform, you need to launch the interpreter, which takes commands one at a time and runs them. Python was invented by **Guido van Rossum**, and started becoming very popular in the early 2000's. It completely dirupted **Perl**, which was one of the most popular scripting languages at the time.\n","\n","Which one is better: Java or Python or C++? Well, it depends. If you require optimal speed and low-level control over hardware, C/C++ is probably the best language. If you're developing enterprise software systems, then Java is likely what you would use. If you're doing Data Science, or quick-n-dirty programs (i.e., scripts), then Python is a good choice."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"cp8mUrwSMa0l","executionInfo":{"elapsed":136,"status":"ok","timestamp":1684596842349,"user":{"displayName":"Cody Kurpanek","userId":"08750046718752847062"},"user_tz":420},"outputId":"9a3b56ad-40a5-4133-af22-d3f5c1b24ea1"},"source":["print(\"Hello, Ethan!\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, Ethan!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Today is: Saturday, May 6, 2024\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Hr9Chfv5pKvf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710699630605,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Cody Kurpanek","userId":"08750046718752847062"}},"outputId":"d9d146fd-252c-4b8c-e903-91b707a39391"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Today is: Saturday, May 6, 2024\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0VBvFjfhLmdf"},"source":["## Fun with variables\n","Variables store data.
